## :page_with_curl: About

React project developed by [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/) at the end of Unit 12 ([Front-end Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/2_Desenvolvimento-Front-end)) of Trybe's Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a _iTunes_-style React application using the React Router library and fetching music data from the Apple Music's API.

### Note

This project is still under development. I am implementing the layout, and I will refactor the code. I haven't deployed the application yet.

### In progress

- [ ] Finishing CSS
- [ ] Refactoring the code to use the Redux library
- [ ] Implementing integration tests with React Testing Library (RTL)
- [ ] Adding English translation (the project is currently only available in Brazilian Portuguese)
